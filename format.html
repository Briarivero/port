<div>
  React is a <span class="text-orange">JavaScript library</span> that enables
  developers to create
  <span class="text-blue">dynamic and interactive</span> user interfaces for web
  applications. Unlike traditional methods of building UIs, React allows
  developers to build components that can efficiently update and render the
  right elements when data changes, making it ideal for
  <span class="text-pink">dynamic</span> and
  <span class="text-blue">responsive</span> web applications.
  <div>
    By using React, developers can create
    <span class="text-orange">component-based architectures</span> where the UI
    is broken down into smaller, reusable components. This enables the creation
    of <span class="text-pink">modular</span> and
    <span class="text-blue">maintainable</span> applications, where each
    component manages its own state and can be independently tested and updated.
    <div>
      React also supports
      <span class="text-blue">declarative programming</span>, meaning developers
      can describe what the UI should look like based on the current state, and
      React will efficiently manage the updates. This leads to
      <span class="text-orange">faster</span> and more
      <span class="text-blue">scalable</span> web applications with better
      performance and easier maintenance.
